    _The Osmosis automated market maker (AMM) affords users the ability to create new and unique liquidity pools that are controlled and voted on by participants. 
    The Osmosis token (OSMO) is used to vote, stake, and provide liquidity throughout its pools. Superfluid staking, a process novel to the Osmosis protocol, 
    allows users to stake assets to secure the network while simultaneously providing assets in a liquidity pool._

    **The Cosmos Ecosystem:**

    Osmosis is a¬†decentralized exchange (DEX)¬†and¬†automated market maker (AMM)¬†protocol for the¬†Cosmos ecosystem. To understand the specifics of Osmosis, 
    it‚Äôs helpful for you to know the context of the Cosmos ecosystem upon which and for which it is built. Cosmos is an overarching ecosystem of blockchain 
    networks that can connect with one another as part of Cosmos‚Äô mission to build an ‚Äúinternet of blockchains.‚Äù¬†Interoperable¬†decentralized applications (dApps)¬†
    on these various networks communicate with each other and send tokens and data back and forth via Cosmos‚Äô¬†Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol.

    **OSMO Token:**

    OSMO is the native token of the Osmosis network. Primarily, OSMO is used for staking to secure the Osmosis chain. As a PoS token, OSMO is inflationary. 
    Over time, new tokens will be minted and entered into circulation.¬†

    **Liquidity** refers to how quickly a financial asset may be turned into actual money. An asset is more valuable the more liquid it is. Without this liquidity, 
    investors might not be able to place buy or sell orders unless someone comes along and matches them. Tokens that can be used to withdraw money from the pool 
    are given to everyone who adds liquidity to it.

    **Locking liquidity** makes the funds immovable until they are unlocked. This means that a certain percentage of the asset has been locked and cannot be withdrawn 
    by the developers which gives investors a sense of security against their investments. Liquidity is locked using time-locked smart contracts.

    **Staking** is when you lock crypto assets for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain. In return for staking your crypto, you earn 
    more cryptocurrency. Many blockchains use a proof of stake consensus mechanism.

    **Superfluid Staking** is described as ‚Äúthe biggest addition to Proof of Stake since slashing.‚Äù It applies a method by which those who provide liquidity to 
    certain pools can earn additional yield by also staking these bonded assets to a validator for staking rewards.

        There is a Balances table launched under Osmosis ‚Üí _osmosis.core.fact_daily_balances_ In the table, we have 4 balance types:

        **liquid:**  Liquidity in cryptocurrency markets essentially refers to¬†the ease with which tokens can be swapped to other tokens¬†(or to government issued fiat currencies).¬†This balance is the total liquidity provided by the wallet with the corresponding token.

        **locked liquidity:** Locking liquidity¬†makes the funds immovable until they are unlocked. This means that a certain percentage of the asset has been locked and can not be withdrawn by the developers which give investors a sense of security against their investments.

        **staked:**  Staking is¬†the process of locking up crypto holdings in order to obtain rewards or earn interest.

        **superfluid staked:** Superfluid Staking allows users to both stake tokens while simultaneously using them to provide assets to a liquidity pool. This means users are rewarded for helping secure the blockchain while staking, and receive reward fees associated with liquidity pool transactions.

        For this approach, we used the following three tables:

        Get the Daily Balances from the table _**osmosis.core.fact_daily_balances**_ by filtering with different currencies by different balance types.

        Join with the table _**osmosis.core.ez_prices**_ to get the price for the currency field in the balances table on daily basis so that we can calculate 
        the Balance in USD for all the wallets & their corresponding tokens.

    The OSMO token was released with an initial supply of 100 million tokens, which was allocated evenly between airdrops to ATOM holders and a strategic reserve.

    According to the _**Osmosis Blog**_:

    ‚ÄúIn the first year, there will be a total of 300 million tokens released. After 365 days, this will be cut by a third, and thus there will be a total of 
    200 million tokens released in year two. In year three there will be a total of 133 million tokens released. And so on. This thirdening process will allow OSMO to 
    reach an asymptotic maximum supply of one billion.‚Äù 

    New tokens are distributed as follows:

    - 25% to rewards for staking
    - 25% to vesting for developers
    - 45% for liquidity mining incentives
    - 5% to the community pool

    The OSMO token is the main governance token of the Osmosis Protocol as well as the native currency of the Osmosis blockchain. Osmosis is a proof of stake blockchain, 
    which means validator nodes must have a certain amount of OSMO staked to confirm transaction blocks. 

    Right now different liquidity pools on Osmosis generate anywhere from 30% to 100% or more as LP rewards per annum. These rates will see a significant drop after the thirdening. By how much is yet to be seen.

    Osmosis also gives about 54% per annum as staking rewards and this will go down after the thirdening.

    The **Superfluid Staking** unlocks two different APRs for LPs comes in‚Äìenabling smaller zones to attract investors with high yields, without compromising on security. The
     new feature will incentivize the increased health of the $70 billion Cosmos ecosystem by securing smaller zones whose tokens are listed on Osmosis, while providing those chains with liquidity.

    Osmosis has rapidly grown since it launched in June 2021 but we see a declined growth of price in bear market. But since one week, we again see a good price trend of OSMO.
